[[vaadin-grid.styling]]
= Styling

The appearance of [vaadinelement]#vaadin-grid# is designed to fit in with the https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/[Material Design] language from Google.
This section will explain how you can customize the look of your [vaadinelement]#vaadin-grid# to fit your own application theme.
Some CSS properties such as `font-family` will be inherited from the containing page, while others may need to be changed with custom CSS properties and mixins.

[[vaadin-grid.sorting.sizing]]
== Sizing

By default [vaadinelement]#vaadin-grid# takes all horizontal space available and set its height depending on the number of data rows.
You can change this behavior by using standard sizing properties, such as `width` and `height`.

The height can also be defined as the number of rows to be displayed by using the [propertyname]#visible-rows# attribute or [propertyname]#grid.visibleRows# JavaScript property.

[[vaadin-grid.sorting.custom]]
== Custom Properties
The [vaadinelement]#vaadin-grid# element is compatible with https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-styles[paper-styles]Â from the https://elements.polymer-project.org/[Polymer Element Catalog].
The selection checkboxes and focus highlights inherit their color from the `--primary-color` defined in the `paper-styles`.
